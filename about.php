            <h2>About the Artist</h2>
            <div class="left">
                <p>Made in China and assembled in the USA, Hiatt Zhao was born in Beijing and moved to the U.S. before becoming a teenager. He currently resides in Pennsylvania. </p>
                <p>Hiatt has been taking photographs for many years and is best known for his abstract architectural photographs, in addition to other more "traditional" photographs. His photos have been publicly exhibited numerous times in galleries since he was 19 years old. They have been collected by a well known university in upstate New York. Collectors of Hiatt's work often include leaders of corporations. Subsequently, they have been displayed in offices around the world, including Beijing, Shanghai, and New York City. While individuals collect his work, private institutions have also used his photographs commercially. Moreover, Hiatt has published two books on photography.</p>
       
                <p>One of the basic human functions is looking with our eyes. What we see is what we get. An observer often appreciates the golden sunset or the beauty that is quintessential to a spring flower. We are conditioned to have little trouble seeing what is presented to us. But there is a sense of mystery to many things in our lives, and what we see might not be so apparent. One such thing is my architectural reflection photographs.
                </p>
                <p>My works present the viewer with reflections from modern, glassy skyscrapers. A few glass windows may not seem to be interesting, however, as a photographer, I capture the hidden beauty in those seemingly mundane looking glass tiles. The result is photographs that are intriguing yet simple, complex but balanced, layered and geometric, modular and abstract. Aiming for the highest aesthetic beauty, I apply a sense of equilibrium using composition and coloration. These architectural abstract photographs serve as reminders to ourselves that there is often more to what we observe as ordinary.
